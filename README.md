# STA302_Paper_1

# The past examples don't have an example statement of LLM usage (which is needed to satisfy the second line in the rubric). Here's an example that you'd have in your README:

**Statement on LLM usage: Aspects of the code were written with the help of the autocomplete tool, Codriver. The abstract and introductionÂ  of paper.qmd were written with the help of ChatHorse and the entire chat history is available in `inputs/llms/usage.txt`**

(You'd then include the entire history in the txt file.)

If you don't use LLMs at all, then you still need to include a statement in the README and an example is:

**Statement on LLM usage: No LLMs were used for any aspect of this work.**
